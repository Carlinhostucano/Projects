# Projects
I'm new here on Github, and I'm kinda new on coding too. I made this simple Python calculator today and I'm looking for things I may improve in it.
I would appreciate ANY suggestion. It can be for making the code shorter, for adding new features or for fixing some bugs.
And, if you want, you can leave a tip as well. I would appreciate that too. Thanks for your attention.
(The calculator requires the Tkinter Library)
